          <p>
            Education is powerful— it’s the key to development! We’re a group of UC Berkeley students from diverse majors and backgrounds seeking to learn about computer science education systems in developing countries and how we can help improve them. In the past, we have worked with She Can Code Rwanda, a nonprofit started and run by Rwandans to teach girls how to code.
